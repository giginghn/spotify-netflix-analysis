# Spotify and Netflix Analysis

It’s the end of the year when Spotify release 2019 Wrapped. I was amazed how my playlists varied in genres and artists across the globe. I could listen to musical songs non-stop 2 years ago, but my music taste changed to pop and ballad this year. Inspired by Spotify Wrapped, I decided to do a fun analysis not only on mine but also on my boyfriend’s taste in music to figure out what the data will take us. 

In addition to music, I’m curious how similar our movie tastes are by analysing our Netflix viewing history. Understanding these nuances, I can save time on deciding which movies to watch or songs to listen to, and better recommend our common interests when we spend time together. It’s also a special way to show love and care to your loved one ;)
